      Hollow Knight is a game in a genre of metroidvania. It takes place in a ruined kingdom full of bugs or what is left of them at least. Explore vast caves, bizzare passages, a serene <span class="hint4">capital</span> and ancient ruins to uncover
      mysteries of this world. This game with beautiful artstyle, followed by amazing music arrangement is guaranteed to capture you for hours upon hours. Metroidvania games are good at gradually revealing the world while the player explores it.
      Games like this are designed to lock away certain parts of it until the player reaches a certain ability or activates a certain event. This allows the player to sense progress as they are able to reach new places with their new powers.

    <h2 class="headers">My opinion on the game</h2>
    <p style="float: left; width: 65%; margin-left: 20px;">
      In my opinion, this game is a gem among indie games. All aspects of it are carefully crafted and intertwined to create a refined world with its unique <span class="hint4">charm</span>. The story is mysterious and isn't given to the player on a
      plate. The player has to collect pieces of lore from tablets, dialogues and <span class="hint3">Hunter's journal</span> and <span class="hint2">connect</span> it all to get a bigger picture of what happened in that ruined kingdom. As you play,
      you understand more and more until the ending nails all of the pieces you collected so far together. And even then, you have so much extra lore and little stories and mysteries that are yet to be discovered. The music and art are absolutely
      beautiful. Both play a big part on setting Hollow Knight's dark and serene atmosphere. It is a delight to listen and look at the game. The gameplay is very satisfying, yet challenging. It has easy to handle and responsive controls and fairly
      simple mechanics. However, they work together very well to create a complex ways to play the game. The game is not easy, but fair with its difficulty. Nothing feels <span class="hint2">out of place</span> in this game. To <span
        class="hint3">sum</span> up, Hollow Knight is probably one of the best games I've ever played, definitely in my top 5.
